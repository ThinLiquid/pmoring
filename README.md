## why do we need yet another webring script??
1. a lot of other webring scripts are bloated
2. webrings should be easy to customize
## how the f*** do i use pmoring
check out `example.html` and `pmoring.config.js` its that simple.
### built-in variables
- `item`: The current item in the list
- `prev`: The previous item in the list
- `next`: The next item in the list
- `index`: The current index of the item in the list
- `random`: A random item in the list

> **Note:** `pmoring.js` and `pmoring.config.js` have to be in the same directory.
